# Introduction:
The client was the UAE Government regulatory authority that needs an online automated system for the validation of professional engineers through an online examination platform. This was a multi-role platform on which engineers need to pass the test for proving their professional eligibility. They needed a complete Smart Automated solution that can pass the engineer through a process of registration and validation, the system gave him the facility to select the slot and test he want to give and can monitor him through smart Invigilation tools integrated into the system so that Government Authority can approve certificate to that engineer to work in UAE. 
Based on my remarkable journey client contacted me for the development of this system that includes all the functionalities as per stakeholders' requirements.
I developed a testing platform for professional engineers to validate their eligibility and include all the requirements as per stakeholders' demands.
